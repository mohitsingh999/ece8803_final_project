According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background, we will use Python and the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. We will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. GameWindow: This class will represent the main game window and handle the game loop, user input, and rendering.

2. Paddle: This class will represent the player's paddle and handle its movement.

3. Ball: This class will represent the ball and handle its movement and collision detection.

4. VideoPlayer: This class will handle the embedded video window and play the background video.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of each file.

**game.py**

This implementation creates a ping pong game with a graphical user interface using Pygame. The game window includes a player-controlled paddle, a bouncing ball, and an embedded video window for the background. The game loop handles user input, updates the game objects, and renders them on the screen.

[2023-23-11 19:21:17 INFO] **[Seminar Conclusion]**:

 To create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background, we will use Python and the Pygame library for the graphical user interface. We will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. GameWindow: This class will represent the main game window and handle the game loop, user input, and rendering.

2. Paddle: This class will represent the player's paddle and handle its movement.

3. Ball: This class will represent the ball and handle its movement and collision detection.

4. VideoPlayer: This class will handle the embedded video window and play the background video.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of each file.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will discuss and design many decorative images for GUI decoration. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent elements in GUI that are being considered to be decorated by different pictures. For example, ten digits (0-9) in a calculator are functionally independent.
To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements. For example:
'''
button_1.png: The button with the number "1" on it.
button_multiply.png: The button with the multiplication symbol ("*") on it.
background.png: the background color to decorate the Go game
'''
Now, list all functionally independent elements as much as possible.

Note that the designed images have a fixed size of 256x256 pixels and the images are located in the same directory as all the Python files; please dynamically scaling these images according to the size of GUI, and use "self.*" to avoid displaying-related problems caused by automatic garbage collection. For example:
```
self.image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open("./image.png").resize((50, 50)))
```
Now, use some or all of the pictures into the GUI to make it more beautiful and creative. Output codes strictly following the required format mentioned above.

For example, a video cycling through a list of digits(0-9) is functionally independent. To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements.

Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will use the previous images generated to formulate a beautiful video stream. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent elements in GUI that are being considered to be decorated by a video generated from a collection of images. For example, a video cycling through a list of digits(0-9) is functionally independent.
To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements. For example:
'''
button_1.mp4: A video composed of previous button images"1" on it.
button_multiply.mp4: A video composed of previous button operations ("*") on it.
background.mp4: A moving background video composed from a series of background images
'''
Now, list all functionally independent elements as much as possible.

Here is a new customer's task: create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background.
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To beautify the graphical user interface (GUI) of the ping pong game, we can use the following functionally independent elements:

1. button_exit.mp4: A video composed of previous button images with an "exit" label on it.
2. button_pause.mp4: A video composed of previous button images with a "pause" label on it.
3. button_restart.mp4: A video composed of previous button images with a "restart" label on it.
4. button_resume.mp4: A video composed of previous button images with a "resume" label on it.
5. button_start.mp4: A video composed of previous button images with a "start" label on it.
6. score_board.mp4: A video composed of previous score board images.
7. video_player.mp4: A video composed of previous video player images.

These videos can be created by combining the respective images using video editing software or libraries in Python, such as OpenCV or MoviePy. By embedding these videos as the background of the GUI elements, we can enhance the visual appeal of the ping pong game.
