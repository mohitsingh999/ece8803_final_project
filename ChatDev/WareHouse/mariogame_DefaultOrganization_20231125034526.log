According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "create a mario game".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

Here is a new customer's task: create a mario game.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

main.py

```python
'''
This is the main file of the Mario game.
'''

import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

# Initialize the game
pygame.init()

# Set up the game window
screen_width, screen_height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Mario Game")

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            running = False

    # Update game logic

    # Render graphics

    pygame.display.update()

# Clean up the game
pygame.quit()
```

In the main.py file, we initialize the pygame library, set up the game window, and create a game loop that handles events, updates game logic, and renders graphics. The game loop will continue running until the user closes the window.

Next, we will create a player.py file to handle the player character.

player.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Player class for the Mario game.
'''

import pygame

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((32, 32))
        self.image.fill((255, 0, 0))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2)
        self.speed = 5

    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            self.rect.y -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
            self.rect.y += self.speed

    def draw(self, screen):
        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
```

In the player.py file, we define the Player class which inherits from the pygame.sprite.Sprite class. The Player class has an image, a rectangle for collision detection, a speed attribute, and methods to update its position based on user input and draw itself on the screen.

Finally, we will create a game.py file to manage the game and its components.

game.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Game class for the Mario game.
'''

import pygame
from player import Player

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
        self.all_sprites.add(self.player)

    def run(self):
        running = True
        while running:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False

            self.all_sprites.update()

            screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
            self.all_sprites.draw(screen)

            pygame.display.flip()

        pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.run()
```

In the game.py file, we define the Game class which initializes the player and manages the game loop. The game loop handles events, updates all sprites, clears the screen, and draws all sprites on the screen. The game will continue running until the user closes the window.

These three files together form the core of the Mario game. You can add more files and classes as needed to implement additional game features and functionalities.

 main.py

```python
'''
This is the main file of the Mario game.
'''

import pygame
from pygame.locals import *

# Initialize the game
pygame.init()

# Set up the game window
screen_width, screen_height = 800, 600
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Mario Game")

# Game loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == QUIT:
            running = False

    # Update game logic

    # Render graphics

    pygame.display.update()

# Clean up the game
pygame.quit()
```

In the main.py file, we initialize the pygame library, set up the game window, and create a game loop that handles events, updates game logic, and renders graphics. The game loop will continue running until the user closes the window.

Next, we will create a player.py file to handle the player character.

player.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Player class for the Mario game.
'''

import pygame

class Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.image = pygame.Surface((32, 32))
        self.image.fill((255, 0, 0))
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = (screen_width // 2, screen_height // 2)
        self.speed = 5

    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            self.rect.y -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
            self.rect.y += self.speed

    def draw(self, screen):
        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)
```

In the player.py file, we define the Player class which inherits from the pygame.sprite.Sprite class. The Player class has an image, a rectangle for collision detection, a speed attribute, and methods to update its position based on user input and draw itself on the screen.

Finally, we will create a game.py file to manage the game and its components.

game.py

```python
'''
This file contains the Game class for the Mario game.
'''

import pygame
from player import Player

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = Player()
        self.all_sprites = pygame.sprite.Group()
        self.all_sprites.add(self.player)

    def run(self):
        running = True
        while running:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    running = False

            self.all_sprites.update()

            screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
            self.all_sprites.draw(screen)

            pygame.display.flip()

        pygame.quit()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = Game()
    game.run()
```

In the game.py file, we define the Game class which initializes the player and manages the game loop. The game loop handles events, updates all sprites, clears the screen, and draws all sprites on the screen. The game will continue running until the user closes the window.
