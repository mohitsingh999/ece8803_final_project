As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will create two prompts to generate decorative images for the background of the GUI. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent prompts in GUI that will be combined to generate different pictures.
To answer, use the format: " PROMPT1: DESCRIPTION" where "PROMPT1" is specifying the first prompt and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of PROMPT1. For example:
'''
prompt_1: Jungle with vines. Majestic lighting. Hyper realism. Symmetric artwork. Cinematic. High detail. 8k. --ar 2:3
prompt_2: Underwater coral reef. Majestic lighting. Hyper realism. Symmetric artwork. Cinematic. High detail. 8k. --ar 2:3
'''
Now, list two random, creative prompts about the background environment of the GUI with as much detail as possible. Note that only two prompts must be specified in the exact format requested! Try relating the prompts to the specified task if possible.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), you will incorporate our designed background video for GUI decoration. The already generated background video is named as follows:
background.mp4
Note that the designed background video has a fixed size of 600x400 pixels and is located in the same directory as all the Python files; please add this video to the background of the video game, and use "self.*" to avoid displaying-related problems caused by automatic garbage collection. For example:
```
class Game:
def __init__(self):
pygame.init()
self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((600, 400))
pygame.display.set_caption("Mario Game")
self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
# Load the video
self.video = cv2.VideoCapture("background.mp4")
self.success, self.video_image = self.video.read()
self.running = True
self.level = Level()
self.player = Player()
self.enemy1 = Enemy()
self.enemy2 = Enemy()
self.enemy3 = Enemy()
self.enemies = pygame.sprite.Group()
self.enemies.add(self.enemy1)
self.enemies.add(self.enemy2)
self.enemies.add(self.enemy3)
def run(self):
while self.running:
# Check for collisions
collisions = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self.player, self.enemies, False)
if collisions:
print("Player hit an enemy!")
self.running=False
self.clock.tick(60)
self.success, self.video_image = self.video.read()
if self.success:
self.video_surf = pygame.image.frombuffer(self.video_image.tobytes(), self.video_image.shape[1::-1], "BGR")
else:
self.running = False
self.handle_events()
self.update()
self.render()
pygame.quit()
def handle_events(self):
for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        self.running = False
def update(self):
self.player.update()
self.level.update()
self.enemy1.update()
self.enemy2.update()
self.enemy3.update()
def render(self):
#self.screen.fill((0, 255, 0))
self.screen.blit(self.video_surf, (0, 0))
self.level.render(self.screen)
self.player.render(self.screen)
self.enemy1.render(self.screen)
self.enemy2.render(self.screen)
self.enemy3.render(self.screen)
pygame.display.flip()
if __name__ == "__main__":
game = Game()
game.run()
```
Now, use the video in the background of the GUI to make it more beautiful and creative. Output codes strictly following the required format mentioned above for the main.py file. This video must be present in the final game output!

Please note that I have made some modifications to the code to incorporate the background video into the game. I have added the necessary imports, created a `Game` class, and modified the game loop to handle the video and render it as the background of the game. The level, player, and enemy classes remain the same.

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) NO BLANK FILES!
5) no potential bugs;
6) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
7) The background.mp4 file must be used and integrated into the GUI for a beautiful visualization;
8) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Enemy` class is missing in the code. It is referenced in the `main.py` file, but not imported or implemented anywhere. To fix this, you need to create the `Enemy` class in a separate file and import it in the `main.py` file. Additionally, you need to implement the necessary methods in the `Enemy` class to update and draw the enemy on the screen.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `Enemy` class is missing in the code. It is referenced in the `main.py` file, but not imported or implemented anywhere. To fix this, you need to create the `Enemy` class in a separate file and import it in the `main.py` file. Additionally, you need to implement the necessary methods in the `Enemy` class to update and draw the enemy on the screen."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments.

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `handle_events` method in the `Game` class is not being called in the game loop. This means that the game will not respond to any user input, such as keyboard events. To fix this, you need to call the `handle_events` method inside the game loop, before the `update` and `render` methods are called.

Here's the revised code for the `run` method in the `Game` class:

```python
def run(self):
    running = True
    while running:
        self.handle_events()  # Call the handle_events method
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        # Check for collisions
        collisions = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self.player, self.enemies, False)
        if collisions:
            print("Player hit an enemy!")
            running = False
        self.clock.tick(60)
        self.update()
        self.render()
    pygame.quit()
```

Please make this change in the `main.py` file.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `handle_events` method in the `Game` class is not being called in the game loop. This means that the game will not respond to any user input, such as keyboard events. To fix this, you need to call the `handle_events` method inside the game loop, before the `update` and `render` methods are called.

Here's the revised code for the `run` method in the `Game` class:

```python
def run(self):
    running = True
    while running:
        self.handle_events()  # Call the handle_events method
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        # Check for collisions
        collisions = pygame.sprite.spritecollide(self.player, self.enemies, False)
        if collisions:
            print("Player hit an enemy!")
            running = False
        self.clock.tick(60)
        self.update()
        self.render()
    pygame.quit()
```

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) NO BLANK FILES!
5) no potential bugs;
6) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
7) The background.mp4 file must be used and integrated into the GUI for a beautiful visualization;
8) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

Here is a new customer's task: create a mario game w/ mario jumping and dodging enemies, using pygame and a game, level, and player class .
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `handle_events` method in the `Game` class is not being called in the game loop. This means that the game will not respond to any user input, such as keyboard events.

To fix this, you need to call the `handle_events` method inside the game loop, before the `update` and `render` methods. Here's the updated code:

```python
def run(self):
    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        self.handle_events()  # Call handle_events method
        self.update()
        self.render()
        self.clock.tick(60)
    pygame.quit()
```

With this change, the game will now respond to user input and handle events correctly.

Comments on Codes:
"<Comment>
The highest priority comment is that the `handle_events` method in the `Game` class is not being called in the game loop. This means that the game will not respond to any user input, such as keyboard events.

To fix this, you need to call the `handle_events` method inside the game loop, before the `update` and `render` methods. Here's the updated code:

```python
def run(self):
    running = True
    while running:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                running = False
        self.handle_events()  # Call handle_events method
        self.update()
        self.render()
        self.clock.tick(60)
    pygame.quit()
```

With this change, the game will now respond to user input and handle events correctly."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.
