I think for a ping pong game, the most suitable product modality would be an Application. It can provide a visualized and interactive experience for the users, allowing them to play the game using their devices.

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "create a ping pong game".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Chief Technology Officer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You are very familiar to information technology. You will make high-level decisions for the overarching technology infrastructure that closely align with the organization's goals, while you work alongside the organization's information technology ("IT") staff members to perform everyday operations.
Here is a new customer's task: create a ping pong game.
To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

To create a ping pong game in Python with a graphical user interface (GUI), we will use the Pygame library. Pygame provides functionality for creating games and multimedia applications.

Here is the outline of the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our ping pong game:

1. GameWindow class: This class will handle the game window and user input.

   - `__init__(self, width, height)`: Initializes the game window with the specified width and height.
   - `run(self)`: Starts the game loop and handles user input.

2. Paddle class: This class will represent the paddles in the game.

   - `__init__(self, x, y)`: Initializes the paddle with the specified initial position.
   - `move_up(self)`: Moves the paddle up.
   - `move_down(self)`: Moves the paddle down.
   - `draw(self, surface)`: Draws the paddle on the game surface.

3. Ball class: This class will represent the ball in the game.

   - `__init__(self, x, y, speed)`: Initializes the ball with the specified initial position and speed.
   - `move(self)`: Moves the ball.
   - `check_collision(self, paddles)`: Checks for collision with the paddles.
   - `draw(self, surface)`: Draws the ball on the game surface.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the code.

**game.py**

```python
import pygame
from paddle import Paddle
from ball import Ball

class GameWindow:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        pygame.init()
        self.width = width

        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Ping Pong Game")
        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
        self.is_running = True
        self.paddle1 = Paddle(20, height // 2 - 50)
        self.paddle2 = Paddle(width - 40, height // 2 - 50)
        self.ball = Ball(width // 2, height // 2, 5)

            self.ball.move()
            self.ball.check_collision([self.paddle1, self.paddle2])

            self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
            self.paddle1.draw(self.screen)
            self.paddle2.draw(self.screen)
            self.ball.draw(self.screen)
            pygame.display.flip()
            self.clock.tick(60)

        pygame.quit()

    def move_up(self):

    def draw(self, surface):
        pygame.draw.rect(surface, (255, 255, 255), (self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height))
```

**ball.py**

```python

        if self.y <= 0 or self.y >= 590:

```

This code creates a basic ping pong game using Pygame. The `GameWindow` class handles the game window and user input. The `Paddle` class represents the paddles, and the `Ball` class represents the ball. The game loop in the `run` method updates the game state, checks for collisions, and draws the game objects on the screen.

To run the game, you can execute the `game.py` file. Make sure you have Pygame installed (`pip install pygame`) before running the code.

Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will discuss and design many decorative images for GUI decoration. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent elements in GUI that are being considered to be decorated by different pictures. For example, ten digits (0-9) in a calculator are functionally independent.
To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements. For example:
'''
button_1.png: The button with the number "1" on it.
button_multiply.png: The button with the multiplication symbol ("*") on it.
background.png: the background color to decorate the Go game
'''
Now, list all functionally independent elements as much as possible.
