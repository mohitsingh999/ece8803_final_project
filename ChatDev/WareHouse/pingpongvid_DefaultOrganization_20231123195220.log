According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "create a ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To complete the task, You must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

main.py

```python

'''

This is the main file of the ping pong game with an embedded video window for the background.

'''

import tkinter as tk
import cv2

class PingPongGame:
    def __init__(self, root):
        self.root = root
        self.root.title("Ping Pong Game")
        self.root.geometry("800x600")
        
        self.video_frame = tk.Frame(self.root)
        self.video_frame.pack()
        
        self.canvas = tk.Canvas(self.root, width=800, height=600)
        self.canvas.pack()
        
        self.video_label = tk.Label(self.video_frame)
        self.video_label.pack()
        
        self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture("background_video.mp4")
        self.show_video()
        
        self.root.mainloop()
    
    def show_video(self):
        ret, frame = self.cap.read()
        if ret:
            frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
            frame = cv2.resize(frame, (800, 600))
            img = Image.fromarray(frame)
            img = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image=img)
            self.video_label.configure(image=img)
            self.video_label.image = img
            self.canvas.after(10, self.show_video)
        else:
            self.cap.release()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    game = PingPongGame(root)

```

In the above code, we have the main file "main.py" which initializes the tkinter window and embeds a video window for the background. The PingPongGame class is responsible for displaying the video and updating it continuously. The video is read from the "background_video.mp4" file using OpenCV. The video frames are then converted to RGB format, resized to fit the canvas, and displayed in the tkinter window.

Please note that you need to have the "background_video.mp4" file in the same directory as the main.py file for the video to be displayed correctly.

Now, let's create the "background_video.mp4" file with the desired video content.

            frame = cv2.resize(frame, (800, 600))
            img = Image.fromarray(frame)
            img = ImageTk.PhotoImage(image=img)
            self.video_label.configure(image=img)

            self.cap.release()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    game = PingPongGame(root)

```

In the above code, we have the main file "main.py" which initializes the tkinter window and embeds a video window for the background. The PingPongGame class is responsible for displaying the video and updating it continuously. The video is read from the "background_video.mp4" file using OpenCV. The video frames are then converted to RGB format, resized to fit the canvas, and displayed in the tkinter window.

Please note that you need to have the "background_video.mp4" file in the same directory as the main.py file for the video to be displayed correctly.

Now, let's create the "background_video.mp4" file with the desired video content.

To beautify the graphical user interface (GUI) of the ping pong game, we can consider decorating the following functionally independent elements with appropriate images:

1. paddle.png: The image of the paddle used to hit the ball in the game.
2. ball.png: The image of the ball that moves around the game area.
3. net.png: The image of the net that divides the game area into two halves.
4. score_board.png: The image of the score board that displays the current score of the game.
5. start_button.png: The image of the start button to initiate the game.
6. restart_button.png: The image of the restart button to restart the game after it ends.
7. pause_button.png: The image of the pause button to temporarily pause the game.
8. resume_button.png: The image of the resume button to resume the paused game.
9. quit_button.png: The image of the quit button to exit the game.
10. background_video.mp4: The video file to be played as the background of the game.

These images and video can be used to enhance the visual appeal and user experience of the ping pong game.

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), you will incorporate our designed images for GUI decoration. Here are some ready-made high-quality pictures and corresponding descriptions:
ball.png: The image of the ball that moves around the game area.
net.png: The image of the net that divides the game area into two halves.
paddle.png: The image of the paddle used to hit the ball in the game.
pause_button.png: The image of the pause button to temporarily pause the game.
quit_button.png: The image of the quit button to exit the game.
restart_button.png: The image of the restart button to restart the game after it ends.
resume_button.png: The image of the resume button to resume the paused game.
score_board.png: The image of the score board that displays the current score of the game.
start_button.png: The image of the start button to initiate the game.
Note that the designed images have a fixed size of 256x256 pixels and the images are located in the same directory as all the Python files; please dynamically scaling these images according to the size of GUI, and use "self.*" to avoid displaying-related problems caused by automatic garbage collection. For example:
```
self.image = ImageTk.PhotoImage(Image.open("./image.png").resize((50, 50)))
```
Now, use some or all of the pictures into the GUI to make it more beautiful and creative. Output codes strictly following the required format mentioned above.

Note that each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:
FILENAME

As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and equip the software with a beautiful graphical user interface (GUI), we will use the previous images generated to formulate a beautiful video stream. Now, we keep discussing the GUI beautification by listing some functionally independent elements in GUI that are being considered to be decorated by a video generated from a collection of images. For example, a video cycling through a list of digits(0-9) is functionally independent.
To answer, use the format: " FILENAME.png: DESCRIPTION" where "FILENAME" is the filename of the image and "DESCRIPTION" denotes the detailed description of the independent elements. For example:
'''
button_1.mp4: A video composed of previous button images"1" on it.
button_multiply.mp4: A video composed of previous button operations ("*") on it.
background.mp4: A moving background video composed from a series of background images
'''
Now, list all functionally independent elements as much as possible.
