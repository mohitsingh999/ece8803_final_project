To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "create a mario game".

Modality: "application".

Programming Language: " Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

This is the main file of the Mario game.

from enemy import Enemy

# Initialize the game

    mario.draw(window)
    enemy.draw(window)
    pygame.display.update()

# Quit the game
pygame.quit()

```

mario.py

```python

'''

This file contains the Mario class.

'''

import pygame

class Mario:
    def __init__(self):
        self.image = pygame.image.load("mario.png")
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = 100
        self.rect.y = 100
        self.speed = 5
    
    def update(self):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            self.rect.x -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            self.rect.x += self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            self.rect.y -= self.speed
        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
            self.rect.y += self.speed
    
    def draw(self, window):
        window.blit(self.image, self.rect)

```

enemy.py

```python

'''

This file contains the Enemy class.

'''

import pygame

class Enemy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.image = pygame.image.load("enemy.png")
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.x = 500
        self.rect.y = 100
        self.speed = 3
    
    def update(self):
        self.rect.x -= self.speed
    
    def draw(self, window):
        window.blit(self.image, self.rect)

```

In this implementation, we have the main.py file as the entry point of the game. It initializes the game window, creates instances of the Mario and Enemy classes, and runs the game loop. The Mario class handles the movement and drawing of the player character, while the Enemy class handles the movement and drawing of the enemy character.

Make sure to have the "mario.png" and "enemy.png" files in the same directory as the Python files, or update the file paths accordingly.
